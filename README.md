# AES-file-encryption
python code to convert password-protect file by using AES encryption
The project contains a simple file which you can run using python3 command on any command line(linus terminal or windows command prompt provided python is in the environment variable.)

After running the file,chosse whether you have to encrypt(E) or decrypte(D) a file. The name of the file that needs to be encrypted will be asked in the terminal. Enter the full name of the file and then enter the password. 

The file will be encrypted or in other words, it is changed into a non readable form. To decrypt the file, run the python file again, and this time choose decrypte(D). Enter the full name of the encrypted file and enter the same password that was used for encryption. 
You will see that the file is now decrypted.
